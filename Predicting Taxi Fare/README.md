# New York Yellow Taxi Fare Prediction

Taxis are an integral part of New York City's transportation system. Every day, hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers use taxis to commute, travel, and explore the city. This project delves into predicting taxi fares in New York City using a dataset from April 2022. By analyzing and modeling taxi fare data, we aim to understand the key factors that influence fare prices and provide a predictive model that can be useful for both riders and drivers.

The dataset used in this project offers a comprehensive view of taxi trips in NYC, capturing details like trip distance, duration, pickup and drop-off locations, and of course, the fare. Through this analysis, we hope to uncover patterns and trends that can offer insights into the dynamics of taxi pricing in the city.

Key questions addressed in this analysis include:
- What are the primary factors influencing taxi fares?
- How do trip distances and durations correlate with fare prices?
- Are there specific locations or times of day that have higher fares on average?

By answering these questions, we aim to provide a clear and concise model for predicting taxi fares, which can be a valuable tool for various stakeholders in NYC's transportation ecosystem.

## Project Motivation

- **For Riders**: Estimating the fare before taking a ride can help in budgeting and making informed decisions.
  
- **For Taxi Drivers**: Understanding fare trends and patterns can assist drivers in maximizing their earnings.
  
- **For Policy Makers**: Insights from this analysis can guide transportation policies, especially concerning fare regulations and taxi service quality.
